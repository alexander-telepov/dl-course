    "In this homework you'll implement and train a **Transformer** for POS-tagging. The **main goal** of this homework is to get to know with the **Transformer architecture** and to understand how it works from the inside.\n",

    "\n",

    "ConvNets can be better than Transformers in POS-tagging task in the case of small data. In this homework you'll train models on a very small dataset (12 543 train sentences) which is ridiculous on the scale of modern NLP datasets (millions or even billions of sentences!). Anyway, it's very important to understand how Transformers work and to be ready to apply them in a real-world problem with a large dataset, where Transformers outperform other architectures (Conv, RNN, ...) by a large margin.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Transformer's encoder attempts to *transform* the entire source sentence, $X = (x_1, ... ,x_n)$, into a sequence of context vectors, $Z = (z_1, ... , z_n)$. So, if our input sequence was 5 tokens long we would have $Z = (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)$. Why do we call this a sequence of context vectors and not a sequence of hidden states? A hidden state at time $t$ in an RNN has only seen tokens $x_t$ and all the tokens before it. However, each context vector here has seen all tokens at all positions within the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karfly/learning-deep-learning/master/09_transformer/static/transformer-encoder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the tokens are passed through a standard embedding layer. Next, as the model has no recurrence it has no idea about the order of the tokens within the sequence. We solve this by using a second embedding layer called a *positional embedding layer*. This is a standard embedding layer where the input is not the token itself but the position of the token within the sequence, starting with the first token, the `<bos>` (beginning of sequence) token, in position 0. The position embedding has a \"vocabulary\" size of `max_length`, which means our model can accept sentences up to `max_length` tokens long.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Transformer implementation from the [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper does not learn positional embeddings. Instead it uses a fixed static embedding. Modern Transformer architectures, like [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), use positional embeddings instead, so we'll use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the token and positional embeddings are elementwise summed together to get a vector which contains information about the token and also its position within the sequence. However, before they are summed, the token embeddings are multiplied by a scaling factor which is $\\sqrt{d_{model}}$, where $d_{model}$ is the hidden dimension size, `hid_dim`. This (supposedly) reduces variance in the embeddings and the model is difficult to train reliably without this scaling factor. Dropout is then applied to the combined embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined embeddings are then passed through $N$ *encoder layers* to get $Z$, which is the output and can be used for any downstream task (e.g. POS-tagging).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mask, `mask`, is simply the same shape as the source sentence but has a value of 1 when the token in the source sentence is not a `<pad>` token and 0 when it is a `<pad>` token. This is used in the encoder layers to mask the multi-head attention mechanisms, which are used to calculate and apply attention over the source sentence, so the model does not pay attention to `<pad>` tokens, which contain no useful information."

This allows neural networks with a larger number of layers, like the Transformer, to be trained easier."

    "### Multi-Head Attention Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key, novel concepts introduced by the Transformer paper is the *multi-head attention layer*. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karfly/learning-deep-learning/master/09_transformer/static/transformer-attention.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention can be thought of as *queries*, *keys* and *values* - where the query is used with the key to get an attention vector (usually the output of a *softmax* operation and has all values between 0 and 1 which sum to 1) which is then used to get a weighted sum of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer uses *scaled dot-product attention*, where the query and the key are combined by taking the dot product between them, then applying the softmax operation, scaling by $d_k$ and finally multiplying by the value. $d_k$ is the *head dimension*, `head_dim`, which we will shortly explain further.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Softmax} \\big( \\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\big)V $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to standard *dot product attention* but is scaled by $d_k$, which the paper states is used to stop the results of the dot products growing large, causing gradients to become too small.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the scaled dot-product attention isn't simply applied to the queries, keys and values. Instead of doing a single attention application the queries, keys and values have their `hid_dim` split into $h$ *heads* and the scaled dot-product attention is calculated over all heads in parallel. This means instead of paying attention to one concept per attention application, we pay attention to $h$. We then re-combine the heads into their `hid_dim` shape, thus each `hid_dim` is potentially paying attention to $h$ different concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(\\text{head}_1,...,\\text{head}_h)W^O $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{head}_i = \\text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$W^O$ is the linear layer applied at the end of the multi-head attention layer, `fc`. $W^Q, W^K, W^V$ are the linear layers `fc_q`, `fc_k` and `fc_v`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps in this module are as follows:\n",
    "1. Calculate $QW^Q$, $KW^K$ and $VW^V$ with the linear layers, `fc_q`, `fc_k` and `fc_v` to get `Q`, `K` and `V`.\n",
    "2. Split the `hid_dim` of the query, key and value into `n_heads` (use `.view`) and correctly permute them so they can be multiplied together.\n",
    "3. Calculate the `energy` (the un-normalized attention) by multiplying `Q` and `K` together and scaling it by the square root of `head_dim`, which is calculated as `hid_dim // n_heads`. Mask the energy not to pay attention over any elements of the sequence we shouldn't.\n",
    "4. Apply the softmax, dropout and then apply the attention to the value heads, `V`, before combining the `n_heads` together.\n",
    "5. Finally, multiply the output of step 4 with $W^O$ (represented as `fc_o`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in our implementation the lengths of the keys and values are always the same, thus when matrix multiplying the output of the softmax, `attention`, with `V` we will always have valid dimension sizes for matrix multiplication. This multiplication is carried out using `torch.matmul` (or `@` operator) which, when both tensors are >2-dimensional, does a batched matrix multiplication over the last two dimensions of each tensor. This will be a **[query len, key len] x [value len, head dim]** batched matrix multiplication over the batch size and each head which provides the **[batch size, n heads, query len, head dim]** result.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that looks strange at first is that dropout is applied directly to the attention. This means that our attention vector will most probably not sum to 1 and we may pay full attention to a token but the attention over that token is set to 0 by dropout. This is never explained, or even mentioned, in the paper however is used by the [official implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/) and every Transformer implementation since, [including BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert/)."
